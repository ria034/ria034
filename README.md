## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate engineer with a background in Robotics, Mechatronics, and Control Systems. My repositories reflect my work in motion and path planning, where I focus on building intelligent robotic systems. I enjoy giving robots the ability to perceive, decide, and actâ€”bridging the gap between control theory and real-world autonomy.
